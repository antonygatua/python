# Python Programming

Welcome to my personal Python learning repository! This repository is a collection of code and projects organized into six main sections: The Basics, Advanced Topics, Datastructures and Algorithms, Frameworks, Testing, and Python Challenges. As I continue my journey in learning Python, this repository serves as a record of my progress and a resource for others who may find it helpful.

## Table of Contents

1. [The Basics](#the-basics)
2. [Datastructures and Algorithms](#datastructures-and-algorithms)
3. [Advanced Topics](#advanced)
4. [Frameworks](#frameworks)
5. [Testing](#testing)

### The Basics

The [Basics section](./The%20Basics) covers fundamental concepts essential for mastering Python programming. It includes topics such as **variables**, **conditional statements**, **type conversion**, **functions**, and various **data structures** like *lists*, *tuples*, *sets*, and *dictionaries*. Additionally, it introduces important concepts like *exception handling* and *file operations*. Mastering these basics provides a strong foundation for tackling more complex problems in Python programming.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in exploring this repository or using it for your own learning, here are the steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/antonygatua/python.git
   ```

   or 

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:antonygatua/python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder of your choice:

   ```bash
   cd python/basics
   ```

   Replace `The Basics` with `Advanced Topics`, `Datastructures and Algorithms`, `Frameworks`, or `Testing` as needed.

3. Explore the code and projects within each folder. Feel free to use them as a reference or starting point for your own learning.
