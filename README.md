# Python Programming

Welcome to my personal Python learning repository! This repository is a collection of code and projects organized into four main folders: Basics, Advanced, Frameworks, and Testing. As I continue my journey in learning Python, this repository serves as a record of my progress and a resource for others who may find it helpful.

## Table of Contents

1. [Basics](#basics)
2. [Advanced](#advanced)
3. [Frameworks](#frameworks)
4. [Testing](#testing)

## Basics

In the Basics folder, you will find fundamental Python concepts and syntax. These exercises and examples are aimed at helping me solidify my understanding of the language's basics.

## Advanced

The Advanced folder contains more complex Python topics and techniques. As I delve deeper into Python, this section will showcase my exploration of advanced programming concepts and best practices.

## Frameworks

In the Frameworks folder, I explore popular Python frameworks. This section includes projects and examples related to frameworks like Django, Flask, and others. Understanding these frameworks is crucial for building robust and scalable applications.

## Testing

The Testing folder is dedicated to testing methodologies and tools in Python. Testing is a crucial aspect of software development, and this section will document my experiments with various testing frameworks and practices.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in exploring this repository or using it for your own learning, here are the steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/antonygatua/python.git
   ```
   or 

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:antonygatua/python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder of your choice:

   ```bash
   cd python/basics
   ```

   Replace `The Basics` with `Advanced Topics`, `Datastructures and Algorithms`,  'Frameworks', or 'Testing' as needed.

3. Explore the code and projects within each folder. Feel free to use them as a reference or starting point for your own learning.
