# Python Programming

Welcome to my personal Python learning repository! This repository is a collection of code and projects organized into six main sections: The Basics, Advanced Topics, Datastructures and Algorithms, Frameworks, Testing, and Python Challenges. As I continue my journey in learning Python, this repository serves as a record of my progress and a resource for others who may find it helpful.

## Table of Contents

1. [The Basics](#the-basics)
2. [Datastructures and Algorithms](#datastructures-and-algorithms)
3. [Advanced Topics](#advanced)
4. [Frameworks](#frameworks)
5. [Testing](#testing)

### The Basics

The [Basics section](./The%20Basics) covers fundamental concepts essential for mastering Python programming. It includes topics such as **variables**, **conditional statements**, **type conversion**, **functions**, and various **data structures** like *lists*, *tuples*, *sets*, and *dictionaries*. Additionally, it introduces important concepts like *exception handling* and *file operations*. Mastering these basics provides a strong foundation for tackling more complex problems in Python programming.

### Datastructures and Algorithms

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computing serving as a building block for efficient problem-solving. This part of the python journey offers a comprehensive introduction to datastructures and algorithms, beginning with an exploration of foundational principles and basics. It explores the various data structures including **arrays**, **linked list**, **trees** and **graphs**, discussing their properties and practical implementation using Python programming. Additionally, it discusses a diverse array of algorithms, such as **sorting**, **searching** and **greedy** algorithms outlining their implementation and analyzing their tim and space complexities.

Also includes practice mock interview questions that aim to provide opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios and refine problem-solving skills. The main aim is these challenges are to reinforce understanding and foster critical thinking abilities. 

## Getting Started

If you're interested in exploring this repository or using it for your own learning, here are the steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/antonygatua/python.git
   ```

   or 

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:antonygatua/python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder of your choice:

   ```bash
   cd python/basics
   ```

   Replace `The Basics` with `Advanced Topics`, `Datastructures and Algorithms`, `Frameworks`, or `Testing` as needed.

3. Explore the code and projects within each folder. Feel free to use them as a reference or starting point for your own learning.
