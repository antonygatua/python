# Variable names can only contain letter, numbers and underscores
# can start with a letter or underscore but not with a number
# spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names
# Avoid using key words and function names as variable names eg print
# variable names should be short but descriptive eg student_name is better than s_n
