# Regular Expressions

Regex is a special sequence of characters that defines a pattern to find a string or a set of strings. Its a search pattern that can be used to check the presence or absence of a string. It is extremely useful for extracting information from text such as codes, files, and documents etc. Its important to understand that everything is essentially a character, and we are writing patterns to match a specific sequence of characters. Can also be used to split a pattern into one or more sub-patterns.

Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters. Special characters include `A`, `a`, or `1` and are the simplest regular expressions. Characters like `|` or `(` are special characters. 

Python has a built in package `re` which can be used to work with regular expressions.
